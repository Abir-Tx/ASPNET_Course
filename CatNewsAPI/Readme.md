# Cat New API

This project is the starting of the final term lessons. The project is to build an API using MS SQL Server

## API Documentation

Head over here to see the implemented API [docs](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/21420955/2s9Y5cugPn)

## Notes

Also it is recommended to follow [this guide](https://github.com/Abir-Tx/EzWatchTicketing/blob/main/docs/devdoc.md#open-project) (Which was not written for this project particularly but is similar. I mean you will get the idea if you are a dev)
